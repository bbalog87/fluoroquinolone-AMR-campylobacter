# Global genomic and statistical modeling analysis of quinolone/fluoroquinolone resistance in Campylobacter isolates

This repository contains data, workflows, and scripts for analyzing quinolone and fluoroquinolone resistance in global Campylobacter isolates. 
The study integrates genomic analyses, statistical association tests, and machine learning models to uncover patterns in resistance-conferring mutations.
Structural modeling of gyrase proteins evaluates the functional impact of key mutations, while predictive models (e.g., random forest, logistic regression) 
explore relationships between mutations, resistance phenotypes, 
and hosts/environment. Temporal modeling further identify trends in resistance evolution, providing actionable insights into the global spread of antimicrobial resistance
